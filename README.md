## Basic Overview

This is just a simple python script to sort a large amoung of audio files by language spoken in them.
This also includes an audio conversion script for converting the base files to WAV format.
The tool as far as I can tell has about a 87/100 average accuracy.

## Usage Instructions

1) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required modules.

2) Place all of your files of any format into the audio_files folder.

3) Run `main.py` and select `y` if you need to convert your files.

## Options

You can change the accuracy and directories at the top of the `main.py` directory.
